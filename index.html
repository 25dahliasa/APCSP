	<p class= "white"> During the 2022-2023 school year I took many rigorous classes: APCSP, English, Modern World History, Spanish 3, Math 3, Honors Chemistry, Social Psychology/Health Science, and acting. Additionally I focused in on many extracurriculars that center around theater, as that is what I would like to pursue in the future. Although this year has been academically challenging, with little freetime, I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I've learned and feel as though I have truly blossomed into a well-rounded, motivated student. I look forward to carrying the knew knowledge I have retained this year through Junior and Senior year.</p>
